# Acropolis Software Shared
Shared items from [Acropolis Software SPRL](https://www.acrosoft.be). These shared utilities are released under the Apache 2.0 license.

At Acropolis Software we maintain a large code base for our main framework (codenamed Gaia) that is at the core of our commercial products.

This framework heavily relies on various open source projects. We decided to contribute back by releasing various utilities that can be extracted from the framework.

We do not anticipate that any of these utilities will be used as-is, but would rather serve as inspirations for ideas or examples. As a consequence:
- We do not make any commitment in term of versioning or backwards compatibility. We could completely refactor the code from one commit to another if we feel like doing so;
- We try to maximize code quality and unit test coverage. After all it is inevitable that our code will end up being copy-pasted in part or in full into other projects, so it is our way to contribute to the overall quality of the projects out there. If you spot any sloppy coding or any mistake in our code, feel free to share it with us. We will be happy to discuss the issue and fix it if necessary.
